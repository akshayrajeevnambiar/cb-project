# ContentBlocks Authentication System

This project implements an alternative login component for ContentBlocks using a traditional username and password system. It integrates with the UI's existing design and leverages Clerk.com for authentication.

2. **Registration Interface:** Designed a registration form allowing users to sign up with a username, email, and password, including input validation and feedback.
3. **State Management:** Used Jotai for state management of authentication processes, form inputs, and error messages.

5. **Responsive Design:** Ensured responsiveness and style consistency using Tailwind CSS.
